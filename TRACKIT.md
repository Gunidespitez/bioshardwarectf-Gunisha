# **REVERSING**
## *Track it*
APPROACH: <br/>
1) We find out the type of database file using File command<br/>
2)It is a squash file which is compressed. <br/>
3)Decompressed the file and then used the GREP command.<br/>
4)As the question stated "the obvious beginning" it is wired, but then states "Reversal of thoughts" so i used Grep deriw.<br/>
5)found the logs and copy pasted in notepad.<br/>
6)To sort them i sorted acc to dates.
7) Found a pattern and subtracted the numbers of the logs to find certain numbers.<br/>
8) Used the ASCII table to convert the subtracted numbers to string.<br/>
9) Found the flag after arranging the string.<br/>
WHAT I LEARNT:  <br/>
1) Learnt how to decompress a squash file.<br/>
2) Learnt about the basic ASCII conversion table.
