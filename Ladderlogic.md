# **OT-security**
## *Logic ladder*
APPROACH: <br/>
1)I saw a few youtube videos to understand how PLC ladders work and their "**and** and **or** cases". <br/>
2) Had to find such values of w,x,y,z which satisfy all the 5 outputs, and all the outputs are ON.  <br/>
3)The ouputs that satisfied w,x,y,z respectively was "0110'.  <br/>
4)Then further used SHA256 online tool to calculate hash/string from binary, and got the flag.  <br/>
WHAT I LEARNT:  <br/>
1) to solve PLC and logic ladders  <br/>
2) to use SHA256 tool
