# **EMBEDDED**
## *Circuit-1*
APPROACH: <br/>
1)Analyzed the circuit from right to left <br/>
2)In order for the LED to be on ,the output 8 must be on for which respectively U3_2Y and U1_3Y must be on, and in such a way i traced back.  <br/>
3) IN 2 , 3 and 8 must be respectively on.  <br/>
WHAT I LEARNT:  <br/>
1) About logic gates; and or not gates etc.
